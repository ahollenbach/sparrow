# Sparrow
Replicating Sparrow in Python

## Installation
1. In PyCharm, `VCS > Checkout From Version Control > GitHub`, then enter your GitHub credentials.
  1. For *Git Repository URL* select `https://github.com/ahollenbach/sparrow.git`
  2. For *Parent Directory* and *Directory Name* just choose where you want it.
3. Open this in a new window, and then you should just need to set up Pyro4


### Pyro4 Installation
Might be differnt for Windows, but here's what I did:

1. Go to `Settings > Project: sparrow > Project Interpreter`
  1. Hit the `+`
  2. Search for `Pyro4` (not `Pyro`!)
  3. Hit `Install Package`

Alternatively, you'll have to follow instructions [here](https://pythonhosted.org/Pyro4/install.html)
